# 💰 Expense Tracker (MERN Stack)

The **Expense Tracker** is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**.  
It provides users with a clean, efficient tool for managing personal finances — allowing you to **track income and expenses**, **view transaction history**, and **calculate running balances in real-time**.

This project follows a **modern decoupled architecture**, where the **frontend** and **backend** are deployed as separate services for scalability and optimized performance.
